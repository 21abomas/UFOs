# UFO Sightings Analysis

### Overview of Project
---------------
The purpose of this analysis is to create a dynamic webpage for UFO sightings that allows users to filter the data based on multiple criteria, such as date, city, state, country, and shape. The project involves modifying an existing HTML page and JavaScript code to incorporate additional filters and functionality.

# Results
The updated web page allows users to search for UFO sightings by filtering on multiple criteria. The user can select a date, city, state, country, and shape from the respective drop-down menus, and press the Enter key to apply the filter. The filtered results are displayed in a table below the filter options.

For example, if a user wants to search for UFO sightings in El Cajon, California, they would select "El Cajon" from the city drop-down menu and "CA" from the state drop-down menu. After pressing the Enter key, the table will display the sightings that match the selected criteria. The user can further refine their search by selecting a specific date or shape from the respective drop-down menus.

# Summary

#### Drawback 
One drawback of the current design is that the filters only allow users to select from pre-defined options. Users cannot enter their own search terms, which may limit the scope of their search results.
#### Two recommendations for further development include:
Adding a search bar that allows users to enter their own search terms, which would increase the flexibility and scope of the search results.
Adding a map feature that displays the location of each UFO sighting on a map, which would provide a visual representation of the data and may reveal patterns or clusters of sightings.
